## What I Build

I like building products that solve real problems and are actually usable.

- End-to-end web apps with strong UX and clean APIs
- Data and analytics tools that support real decisions
- ML features that improve product outcomes (not just demos)
- Embedded + mobile systems with real-time data pipelines
